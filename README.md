This app explores an approach to provide real-time feedback for orienteers.

To use it, you have to import the course coordinates first. This can be done by manually entering them or by importing a GPX file. Those files can for example be created using the popular map-making software OCAD.

This app was developed as part of the master thesis "Real-time Feedback in High Performance Sports Scenarios: A Case Study for Orienteering" in 2014 by Christoph Albert.
